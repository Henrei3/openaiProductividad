{"text": "Agente- Buenos Dias. Agente- Buenos Dias. Hello, good afternoon up here in Scotland! Hello? Hello? Good afternoon. Yes, miss? My name is Mayra Marquez, I work in the cooperative of Co-Progreso. Dear, I need to confirm, dear, it reflects that a payment session was generated, where you indicated that you were going to generate the payment at the end of the month. Yes, but wait. Hello? Yes, dear, help me confirm. Would you generate the total payment at the end of the month or what value will it cancel? You know that I already fixed it, they already fixed it in the 80, right now I'm just out of the cooperative. At this time, did you generate the payment? No, miss, they already refinanced my card. Ah, I see. You mean, the value of the card was going to be different. Exactly. Correct, no problem. In that case, when did you receive the information that you had to cancel the first payment? Yes, until April 2. Until April 2. Yes. Okay, in any case, I'm waiting. If there is any inconvenience, I will contact you again. Yes, the thing is that I have been calling and calling and I have not seen the number. This number will not receive calls. In any case, I will send you a message. Because the information reaches me, my email, and it says, please, cooperative with progress, I will contact you with the number, and that's what I call. I was calling to confirm, even with the lady who spoke to me the first time, but she doesn't answer me, I'm going to call, I'm going to call, that's why I approached the bank, the cooperative, and I just fixed it. I understand."}
